Auto ARIMA Implementation in Python

$exogenous:$ Outside Factors (e.g. other time series)

$m:$ Seasonal Cycle Length (margin)

$max order:$ maximum amount of variables to be used in the regression (p + q) (keep it to 10 or None)

(Trend order are denoted by small_case p, d & q)

$maxp:$ maximum AR components

$maxq:$ maximum MA components

$maxd:$ maximum Integrations

(Seasonal order are denoted by Upper_case P, D & Q

$maxP:$

$maxQ:$

$max_D:$

$Maxiter:$ maximum interations we are giving the model to converge the coefficients (becomes harder as the order increses)

$alpha:$ Level of significance, default is 5% which we should be using most of the time.

$njobs:$ how many models to fit at a time (-1 indicates 'as many as possible")

$trend:$ "ct" usually

information criterion -> "aic", "aicc", "bic", "hqic", "oob" - for validation scoring -- respectively

(Akaike Information Criterion, Corrected Akaike Information Criterion,
Bayesian Information Criterion, Hannan-Quinn Information Criterion, or Out of Bag)
